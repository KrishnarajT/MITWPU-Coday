# MITWPU-Coday
The Work we did for MITWPU Coday Event organized in August of 23 in Third Year. This was an event organized by MIT for 24 hours, with 30 teams of 4 competiting agianst each other to solve a problem. 

# What we did. 
The objective of the event was to code a solution class in java, that would predict the sales of a ficticious company. We were given some sample data, and using that and some pre defined formulas, we just had to predict what how many items the company had to stock for day 5. 

# Time taken. 
It took us about 6 hours to code through, and it was a 24 hour competition. It was in java, and had a few testcases they wanted us to clear. 

# Result
TBD.
